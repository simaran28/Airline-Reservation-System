# Airline-Reservation-System---------------------------------
Airline Reservation System is software that handles the entire booking data of the Flights. 
It is fully based on the concept of reserving flight tickets for various destinations. 
Previously the task of handling the tickets at a time was very difficult,
so there was a need for software that can handle all Airline Reservation System.
Therefore the Airline Reservation System was designed. After the release of this system,
the stress and workload of the employee were absolutely finished. It was also time-wasting for the travelers to book a Ticket previously.
But now it hardly takes 10 to 15 minutes to book a ticket wherever the passenger is.
